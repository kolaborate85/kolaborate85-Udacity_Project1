Udacity Project: Personal Blog website
There are 3 folder in total
These folder contains 2 html file. One for the index website, one folder for the actual blog post, and one for the images.
I initially created 2 css file for each of the html file(website)
Based on suggestion from udacity, I have broken each of the css file into 3 part, this adds up to 6 css file in total.
Two responsive css file have now been added to the 2 main css file. This makes it a total of 4 responsive css files.
